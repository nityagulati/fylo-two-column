## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge. This page started life as a Frontend Mentor Challenge. ðŸŽ‰ Coded by [Nitya Gulati](https://nityagulati.github.io).

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**To do these challenges, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and (sometimes) JavaScript.**

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to.

You can access all the required assets and the style guide on the Frontend Mentor [website](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

## Sharing your solution

There are multiple places you can share your solution:

1. Submit it on the platform so that other users will see your solution on the site. Other users will be able to give you feedback, which could help improve your code for the next project.
2. Share your repository and live URL in the **#finished-projects** channel of the Slack community.
3. Tweet [@frontendmentor](https://twitter.com/frontendmentor) and mention **@frontendmentor** including the repo and live URLs in the tweet. We'd love to take a look at what you've built and help share it around.

## Giving feedback

Feedback is always welcome, so if you have any on this challenge please email **Matt** at matt[at]frontendmentor[dot]io.

This challenge is completely free. Please share it with anyone who will find it useful to practice on.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
